# This repository contains a jupyter notebook program that is analyzing multiple CSV files containing information about 15 schools and the students attending the schools.
# This program will group the schools and students into mulitple different categories to give an idea as to what factors influence the grades of the attending students.

# Written Report: 
# Small and Medium sized schools (less than 2000 students total) have a dramatically improved student passing rate when compared to large school (2000-5000 students.)
# Charter schools also have a dramatically better passing rate of students when compared to district schools.
# From the results in shown from this program, it can be reasonable to infer that in most circumstances, smaller sized schools and charter schools are going to have higher passing rates for their students than larger sized schools and district schools.
